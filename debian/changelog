xpdf (3.02-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Use system poppler library (closes: #351279).
    - Thanks to Martin Pitt for the initial work on xpdf-poppler and to
      Gentoo for maintaining that in their archive for the past couple years.

    - Drop xpdf-utils package; no reason to duplicate poppler-utils anymore
      (closes: #576683).
    - Combine xpdf-reader and xpdf-common into a single package (no reason to
      keep these separate anymore either).
    - This package now replaces the separate xpdf language packages.
    - Drop the following patches (this code is no longer built here; it is now
      provided by poppler):
      - fix-444648.patch

      - fix-CVE-2009-3604.patch
      - fix-CVE-2009-3606.patch
      - fix-CVE-2009-3608.patch
      - fix-CVE-2009-3609.patch
  * Add some patch descriptions.
  * Remove last remnants of dpatch (the package now uses quilt).
  * Fix a quirky floating point comparison that was leading to problems on
    i386 with gcc 4.4 (closes: #577031, #577086).
  * Revert zoomFitHeight patch since it breaks zoomFitPage and zoomFitWidth
    (closes: #576543, 578892).
